## üí° Challenges Faced & Solutions

- **Responsive Timeline:**  
  The vertical timeline line appeared incorrectly on mobile.  
  _Solution:_ Used Tailwind's `hidden md:block` to show the line only on desktop.

- **Custom Cursor on Mobile:**  
  The custom cursor effect was visible on mobile, causing UI issues.  
  _Solution:_ Added a screen width check in JavaScript and used Tailwind's responsive classes to hide it on small screens.

- **Consistent Card Design:**  
  Ensuring project cards matched the overall theme and were visually appealing.  
  _Solution:_ Used Tailwind utility classes for color, spacing, and hover effects, and standardized the card structure in JavaScript.

- **Navbar Animation:**  
  Achieving a smooth underline animation for navigation links.  
  _Solution:_ Refined CSS selectors and transitions for a modern effect.
